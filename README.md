# Hidden Artist

Hidden Artist is a game where each player can only see and interact with a small portion of a larger canvas, and only one person—the "Hidden Artist"—can see the entire picture. The other players are tasked with drawing on their respective sections based on clues, intuition, or instructions from the Hidden Artist, but they can’t see the full artwork. The Hidden Artist can manipulate and rearrange the drawings to guide the final outcome or create their own secret masterpiece.

Key features for The Hidden Artist:

* **Collaborative Gameplay**: Each player contributes without seeing the whole picture, relying on hints or shared elements.
* **Puzzle-Like Design**: The Hidden Artist might need to guide players to draw specific elements to form a cohesive final piece.
* **Creative Manipulation**: The Hidden Artist has the ability to tweak or rearrange portions of the artwork, subtly controlling the direction of the final creation.

Unveiling Moments: At key moments in the game, the full canvas is revealed, surprising everyone with how the combined efforts have come together—or how the Hidden Artist has transformed it.

The core of the game would revolve around mystery, teamwork, and creativity, with a sense of playful discovery as the final artwork is revealed.
